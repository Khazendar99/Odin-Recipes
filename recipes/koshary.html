        </li>
        <li>water to cover

        </li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste

        </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil

        </li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, minced

        </li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced

        </li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes

        </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter

        </li>
        <li>3 cups chicken stock

        </li>
        <li>1 (3 ounce) can French-fried onions

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Step 1</h4>Combine chickpeas, vinegar, coriander, cayenne pepper, and cumin in a resealable bag or container with a tight-fitting lid. Store in refrigerator while prepping remainder of dish, shaking occasionally.</li>
        <li><h4>Step 2</h4>Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook pasta in the boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain and set aside.

        </li>
        <li><h4>Step 3</h4>Combine rice with enough cold water to cover; allow to soak for 20 minutes. Drain.

        </li>
        <li><h4>Step 4</h4>Meanwhile, combine lentils with enough water to cover in a pot; season with salt and pepper. Bring the lentils to a boil and simmer until tender, about 30 minutes. Drain.

        </li>
        <li><h4>Step 5</h4>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes; season with salt and pepper, reduce heat to medium-low, and maintain at a simmer while preparing remainder of dish.

        </li>
        <li><h4>Step 6</h4>Melt butter in a pot over medium-high heat; add rice, increase heat to high, and fry for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Pour in chicken stock and bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper; reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes.

        </li>
        <li><h4>Step 7</h4>Mix rice and lentils together on a large serving platter. Spread cooked pasta over the rice and lentil mixture. Serve with marinated chickpeas, tomato sauce, and French-fried onions.
