    <h2>Ingredients needed</h3>
    <p>Here's what you'll need to make the best fried shrimp of your life:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Flour</h4>
        Dredging your shrimp in all-purpose flour before frying promotes a
        wonderfully crunchy crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Seasonings</h4>
        This fried shrimp is simply seasoned with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Eggs</h4>
        Dipping the floured shrimp in eggs gives the bread crumbs something to
        adhere to.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Bread crumbs</h4>
        Panko bread crumbs add the perfect amount of flavor and crunch.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Shrimp</h4>
        You'll need one pound of peeled, deveined jumbo shrimp.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Oil</h4>
        Vegetable oil is great for frying, as it has a neutral flavor and can
        stand up to high heat.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4>Set up your workspace</h4>
        Mix the flour and seasonings in one bowl. Beat the eggs until frothy in
        a second bowl. Place the bread crumbs in a third bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Dredge, dip, and coat</h4>
        Dredge the shrimp in the flour mixture, then dip it into the eggs.
        Finally, press the shrimp in the crumbs. Turn to coat.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Fry the shrimp</h4>
        Heat oil in a heavy pot to 350 degrees F. Deep fry the shrimp in batches
        until cooked through. Transfer to paper towels to drain.
      </li>
    </ol>
